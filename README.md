# Final_Project
# 🧙‍♂️ AI Dungeon Story Generator

An interactive and creative storytelling project using **GPT-2**, where the user provides a genre and story prompt — and the AI completes it!  
The story is then converted to **audio** and merged with a **background image** to create a **downloadable video** 🎥

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔮 User enters story beginning and genre (Fantasy, Mystery, Horror, etc.)
- 🧠 GPT-2 generates a story continuation based on prompt
- 🗣️ `gTTS` converts the story to realistic voice
- 🎞️ `MoviePy` combines audio + image into a `.mp4` video
- ✅ Entire process runs in **Google Colab**
- 💾 Final downloadable files:
  - `story_audio.mp3`
  - `story_video.mp4`
